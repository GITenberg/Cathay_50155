<span class="title">Song of the Bowmen of Shu</span><br />
<br />
Here we are, picking the first fern-shoots<br />
And saying: When shall we get back to our country?<br />
Here we are because we have the Ken-nin for our<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">foemen,</span><br />
We have no comfort because of these Mongols.<br />
We grub the soft fern-shoots,<br />
When anyone says "Return," the others are full of<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">sorrow.</span><br />
Sorrowful minds, sorrow is strong, we are hungry<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">and thirsty.</span><br />
Our defence is not yet made sure, no one can let<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">his friend return.</span><br />
We grub the old fern-stalks.<br />
We say: Will we be let to go back in October?<br />
There is no ease in royal affairs, we have no comfort.<br />
Our sorrow is bitter, but we would not return to our<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">country.</span><br />
What flower has come into blossom?<br />
Whose chariot? The General's.<br />
Horses, his horses even, are tired. They were strong.<br />
We have no rest, three battles a month.<br />
By heaven, his horses are tired.<br />
The generals are on them, the soldiers are by them<br />
The horses are well trained, the generals have ivory<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">arrows and quivers ornamented with fish-skin.</span><br />
The enemy is swift, we must be careful.<br />
When we set out, the willows were drooping with spring,<br />
We come back in the snow,<br />
We go slowly, we are hungry and thirsty,<br />
Our mind is full of sorrow, who will know of our grief?<br />

Blue, blue is the grass about the river<br />
And the willows have overfilled the close garden.<br />
And within, the mistress, in the midmost of her youth,<br />
White, white of face, hesitates, passing the door.<br />
Slender, she puts forth a slender hand,<br />
<br />
And she was a courtezan in the old days,<br />
And she has married a sot,<br />
Who now goes drunkenly out<br />
And leaves her too much alone.<br />

This boat is of shato-wood, and its gunwales are cut<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">magnolia,</span><br />
Musicians with jewelled flutes and with pipes of gold<br />
Fill full the sides in rows, and our wine<br />
Is rich for a thousand cups.<br />
We carry singing girls, drift with the drifting water,<br />
Yet Sennin needs<br />
A yellow stork for a charger, and all our seamen<br />
Would follow the white gulls or ride them.<br />
Kutsu's prose song<br />
Hangs with the sun and moon.<br />
<br />
King So's terraced palace<br />
<span style="margin-left: 10em;">is now but a barren hill,</span><br />
But I draw pen on this barge<br />
Causing the five peaks to tremble,<br />
And I have joy in these words<br />
<span style="margin-left: 10em;">like the joy of blue islands.</span><br />
(If glory could last forever<br />
Then the waters of Han would flow northward.)<br />
<br />
And I have moped in the Emperor's garden, awaiting<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">an order-to-write!</span><br />
I looked at the dragon-pond, with its willow-coloured<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">water</span><br />
Just reflecting the sky's tinge,<br />
And heard the five-score nightingales aimlessly singing.<br />
<br />
The eastern wind brings the green colour into the island<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">grasses at Yei-shu,</span><br />
The purple house and the crimson are full of Spring<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">softness.</span><br />
South of the pond the willow-tips are half-blue and<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">bluer,</span><br />
Their cords tangle in mist, against the brocade-like<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">palace.</span><br />
Vine-strings a hundred feet long hang down from carved<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">railings,</span><br />
And high over the willows, the fine birds sing to each<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">other, and listen,</span><br />
Crying&mdash;"Kwan, Kuan," for the early wind, and the feel<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">of it.</span><br />
The wind bundles itself into a bluish cloud and wanders off.<br />
Over a thousand gates, over a thousand doors are the sounds<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">of spring&nbsp; singing,</span><br />
And the Emperor is at Ko.<br />
Five clouds hang aloft, bright on the purple sky,<br />
The imperial guards come forth from the golden house with<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">their armour a-gleaming.</span><br />
The emperor in his jewelled car goes out to inspect his<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">flowers,</span><br />
He goes out to Hori, to look at the wing-flapping storks,<br />
He returns by way of Sei rock, to hear the new nightingales,<br />
For the gardens at Jo-run are full of new nightingales,<br />
Their sound is mixed in this flute,<br />
Their voice is in the twelve pipes here.<br />

<span class="title">The River-Merchant's Wife: a Letter</span><br />
<br />
<br />
While my hair was still cut straight across my forehead<br />
I played about the front gate, pulling flowers.<br />
You came by on bamboo stilts, playing horse,<br />
You walked about my seat, playing with blue plums.<br />
And we went on living in the village of Chokan:<br />
Two small people, without dislike or suspicion.<br />
<br />
At fourteen I married My Lord you.<br />
I never laughed, being bashful.<br />
Lowering my head, I looked at the wall.<br />
Called to, a thousand times, I never looked back.<br />
<br />
At fifteen I stopped scowling,<br />
I desired my dust to be mingled with yours<br />
Forever and forever, and forever.<br />
Why should I climb the look out?<br />
<br />
At sixteen you departed,<br />
You went into far Ku-to-Yen, by the river of swirling eddies,<br />
And you have been gone five months.<br />
The monkeys make sorrowful noise overhead.<br />
You dragged your feet when you went out.<br />
By the gate now, the moss is grown, the different mosses,<br />
Too deep to clear them away!<br />
The leaves fall early this autumn, in wind.<br />
The paired butterflies are already yellow with August<br />
Over the grass in the West garden,<br />
They hurt me,<br />
I grow older,<br />
If you are coming down through the narrows of the river Kiang,<br />
Please let me know beforehand,<br />
And I will come out to meet you,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 9em;">As far as Cho-fu-Sa.</span><br />

<span class="title">The Jewel Stairs' Grievance</span><br />
<br />
<br />
The jewelled steps are already quite white with dew,<br />
It is so late that the dew soaks my gauze stockings,<br />
And I let down the crystal curtain<br />
And watch the moon through the clear autumn.<br />
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 60%;"><i>By Rihaku.</i></p>

<hr class="r5" />
<blockquote>
<p>Note.&mdash;Jewel stairs, therefore a palace. Grievance,
therefore there is something to complain, of. Gauze stockings,
therefore a court lady, not a servant who complains. Clear
autumn, therefore he has no excuse on account of weather.
Also she has come early, for the dew has not merely whitened
the stairs, but has soaked her stockings. The poem is
especially prized because she utters no direct reproach.</p>

<span class="title">Poem by the Bridge at Ten-Shin</span><br />
<br />
<br />
March has come to the bridge head,<br />
Peach boughs and apricot boughs hang over a thousand gates,<br />
At morning there are flowers to cut the heart,<br />
And evening drives them on the eastward-flowing waters.<br />
Petals are on the gone waters and on the going,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And on the back-swirling eddies,</span><br />
But to-days men are not the men of the old days,<br />
Though they hang in the same way over the bridge-rail.<br />
<br />
The sea's colour moves at the dawn<br />
And the princes still stand in rows, about the throne,<br />
And the moon falls over the portals of Sei-go-yo,<br />
And clings to the walls and the gate-top.<br />
With head-gear glittering against the cloud and sun,<br />
The lords go forth from the court, and into far borders.<br />
They ride upon dragon-like horses,<br />
Upon horses with head-trappings of yellow-metal,<br />
And the streets make way for their passage.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8.5em;">Haughty their passing,</span><br />
Haughty their steps as they go into great banquets,<br />
To high halls and curious food,<br />
To the perfumed air and girls dancing,<br />
To clear flutes and clear singing;<br />
To the dance of the seventy couples;<br />
To the mad chase through the gardens.<br />
Night and day are given over to pleasure<br />
And they think it will last a thousand autumns,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">Unwearying autumns.</span><br />
For them the yellow dogs howl portents in vain,<br />
And what are they compared to the lady Riokushu,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">That was cause of hate!</span><br />
Who among them is a man like Han-rei<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">Who departed alone with his mistress,</span><br />
With her hair unbound, and he his own skiffs-man!<br />

<span class="title">Lament of the Frontier Guard</span><br />
<br />
<br />
By the North Gate, the wind blows full of sand,<br />
Lonely from the beginning of time until now!<br />
Trees fall, the grass goes yellow with autumn.<br />
I climb the towers and towers<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">to watch out the barbarous land:</span><br />
Desolate castle, the sky, the wide desert.<br />
There is no wall left to this village.<br />
Bones white with a thousand frosts,<br />
High heaps, covered with trees and grass;<br />
Who brought this to pass?<br />
Who has brought the flaming imperial anger?<br />
Who has brought the army with drums and with kettle-drums?<br />
Barbarous kings.<br />
A gracious spring, turned to blood-ravenous autumn,<br />
A turmoil of wars-men, spread over the middle kingdom,<br />
Three hundred and sixty thousand,<br />
And sorrow, sorrow like rain.<br />
Sorrow to go, and sorrow, sorrow returning,<br />
Desolate, desolate fields,<br />
And no children of warfare upon them,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3.5em;">No longer the men for offence and defence.</span><br />
Ah, how shall you know the dreary sorrow at the North Gate,<br />
With Rihoku's name forgotten,<br />
And we guardsmen fed to the tigers.<br />

<span class="title">Exile's Letter</span><br />
<br />
<br />
To So-Kin of Rakuyo, ancient friend, Chancellor of Gen.<br />
Now I remember that you built me a special tavern<br />
By the south side of the bridge at Ten-Shin.<br />
With yellow gold and white jewels, we paid for songs<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">and laughter</span><br />
And we were drunk for month on month, forgetting the<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">kings and&nbsp; princes.</span><br />
Intelligent men came drifting in from the sea and from<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">the west border,</span><br />
And with them, and with you especially<br />
There was nothing at cross purpose,<br />
And they made nothing of sea-crossing or of mountain<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">crossing,</span><br />
If only they could be of that fellowship,<br />
And we all spoke out our hearts and minds, and without<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">regret.</span><br />
<br />
And then I was sent off to South Wei,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">smothered in laurel groves,</span><br />
And you to the north of Raku-hoku,<br />
Till we had nothing but thoughts and memories in common.<br />
<br />
And then, when separation had come to its worst,<br />
We met, and travelled into Sen-Go,<br />
Through all the thirty-six folds of the turning and<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">twisting waters,</span><br />
Into a valley of the thousand bright flowers,<br />
That was the first valley;<br />
And into ten thousand valleys full of voices and<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">pine-winds.</span><br />
And with silver harness and reins of gold,<br />
Out come the East of Kan foreman and his company.<br />
And there came also the "True man" of Shi-yo to meet me,<br />
Playing on a jewelled mouth-organ.<br />
In the storied houses of San-Ko they gave us more Sennin<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">music,</span><br />
Many instruments, like the sound of young phoenix broods.<br />
The foreman of Kan Chu, drunk, danced<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">because his long sleeves wouldn't keep still</span><br />
With that music-playing.<br />
And I, wrapped in brocade, went to sleep with my head on<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">his lap,</span><br />
And my spirit so high it was all over the heavens,<br />
And before the end of the day we were scattered like stars,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">or rain.</span><br />
I had to be off to So, far away over the waters,<br />
You back to your river-bridge.<br />
<br />
And your father, who was brave as a leopard,<br />
Was governor in Hei Shu, and put down the barbarian rabble.<br />
And one May he had you send for me,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6.5em;">despite the long distance.</span><br />
And what with broken wheels and so on, I won't say it wasn't<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">hard going,</span><br />
Over roads twisted like sheeps' guts.<br />
And I was still going, late in the year,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6.5em;">in the cutting wind from the North,</span><br />
And thinking how little you cared for the cost,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6.5em;">and you caring enough to pay it.</span><br />
And what a reception:<br />
Red jade cups, food well set on a blue jewelled table,<br />
And I was drunk, and had no thought of returning.<br />
And you would walk out with me to the western corner of the<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">castle,</span><br />
To the dynastic temple, with water about it clear as blue jade,<br />
With boats floating, and the sound of mouth-organs and drums,<br />
With ripples like dragon-scales, going grass green on the water,<br />
Pleasure lasting, with courtezans, going and coming without<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">hindrance,</span><br />
With the willow flakes falling like snow,<br />
And the vermilioned girls getting drunk about sunset,<br />
And the water a hundred feet deep reflecting green eyebrows<br />
&mdash;Eyebrows painted green are a fine sight in young moonlight,<br />
Gracefully painted&mdash;<br />
And the girls singing back at each other,<br />
Dancing in transparent brocade,<br />
And the wind lifting the song, and interrupting it,<br />
Tossing it up under the clouds.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">And all this comes to an end.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">And is not again to be met with.</span><br />
I went up to the court for examination,<br />
Tried Layu's luck, offered the Choyo song,<br />
And got no promotion,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">and went back to the East Mountains</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 9em;">white-headed.</span><br />
And once again, later, we met at the South bridge-head.<br />
And then the crowd broke up, you went north to San palace,<br />
And if you ask how I regret that parting:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">It is like the flowers falling at Spring's end</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5.5em;">Confused, whirled in a tangle.</span><br />
What is the use of talking, and there is no end of talking,<br />
There is no end of things in the heart.<br />
<br />
I call in the boy,<br />
Have him sit on his knees here<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5.5em;">To seal this,</span><br />
And send it a thousand miles, thinking.<br />

<span class="title">The Seafarer</span><br />
<br />
<br />
(<i>From the early Anglo-Saxon text</i>)<br />
<br />
<br />
May I for my own self song's truth reckon,<br />
Journey's jargon, how I in harsh days<br />
Hardship endured oft.<br />
Bitter breast-cares have I abided,<br />
Known on my keel many a care's hold,<br />
And dire sea-surge, and there I oft spent<br />
Narrow nightwatch nigh the ship's head<br />
While she tossed close to cliffs. Coldly afflicted,<br />
My feet were by frost benumbed.<br />
Chill its chains are; chafing sighs<br />
Hew my heart round and hunger begot<br />
Mere-weary mood. Lest man know not<br />
That he on dry land loveliest liveth,<br />
List how I, care-wretched, on ice-cold sea,<br />
Weathered the winter, wretched outcast<br />
Deprived of my kinsmen;<br />
Hung with hard ice-flakes, where hail-scur flew,<br />
There I heard naught save the harsh sea<br />
And ice-cold wave, at whiles the swan cries,<br />
Did for my games the gannet's clamour,<br />
Sea-fowls' loudness was for me laughter,<br />
The mews' singing all my mead-drink.<br />
Storms, on the stone-cliffs beaten, fell on the stern<br />
In icy feathers; full oft the eagle screamed<br />
With spray on his pinion.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 12em;">Not any protector</span><br />
May make merry man faring needy.<br />
This he little believes, who aye in winsome life<br />
Abides 'mid burghers some heavy business,<br />
Wealthy and wine-flushed, how I weary oft<br />
Must bide above brine.<br />
Neareth nightshade, snoweth from north,<br />
Frost froze the land, hail fell on earth then<br />
Corn of the coldest. Nathless there knocketh now<br />
The heart's thought that I on high streams<br />
The salt-wavy tumult traverse alone.<br />
Moaneth alway my mind's lust<br />
That I fare forth, that I afar hence<br />
Seek out a foreign fastness.<br />
For this there's no mood-lofty man over earth's midst,<br />
Not though he be given his good, but will have in his<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">youth greed;</span><br />
Nor his deed to the daring, nor his king to the faithful<br />
But shall have his sorrow for sea-fare<br />
Whatever his lord will.<br />
He hath not heart for harping, nor in ring-having<br />
Nor winsomeness to wife, nor world's delight<br />
Nor any whit else save the wave's slash,<br />
Yet longing comes upon him to fare forth on the water.<br />
Bosque taketh blossom, cometh beauty of berries,<br />
Fields to fairness, land fares brisker,<br />
All this admonisheth man eager of mood,<br />
The heart turns to travel so that he then thinks<br />
On flood-ways to be far departing.<br />
Cuckoo calleth with gloomy crying,<br />
He singeth summerward, bodeth sorrow,<br />
The bitter heart's blood. Burgher knows not&mdash;<br />
He the prosperous man&mdash;what some perform<br />
Where wandering them widest draweth.<br />
So that but now my heart burst from my breast-lock,<br />
My mood 'mid the mere-flood,<br />
Over the whale's acre, would wander wide.<br />
On earth's shelter cometh oft to me,<br />
Eager and ready, the crying lone-flyer,<br />
Whets for the whale-path the heart irresistibly,<br />
O'er tracks of ocean; seeing that anyhow<br />
My lord deems to me this dead life<br />
On loan and on land, I believe not<br />
That any earth-weal eternal standeth<br />
Save there be somewhat calamitous<br />
That, ere a man's tide go, turn it to twain.<br />
Disease or oldness or sword-hate<br />
Beats out the breath from doom-gripped body.<br />
And for this, every earl whatever, for those speaking after&mdash;<br />
Laud of the living, boasteth some last word,<br />

Aye, for ever, a lasting life's-blast,<br />
Delight mid the doughty.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 12.5em;">Days little durable,</span><br />
And all arrogance of earthen riches,<br />
There come now no kings nor Caesars<br />

Whoe'er lived in life most lordliest,<br />
Drear all this excellence, delights undurable!<br />
Waneth the watch, but the world holdeth.<br />
Tomb hideth trouble.<br />
The blade is laid low.<br />
Earthly glory ageth and seareth.<br />
No man at all going the earth's gait,<br />
But age fares against him, his face paleth,<br />
Grey-haired he groaneth, knows gone companions,<br />
Lordly men are to earth o'ergiven,<br />
Nor may he then the flesh-cover, whose life ceaseth,<br />
Nor eat the sweet nor feel the sorry,<br />
Nor stir hand nor think in mid heart,<br />
And though he strew the grave with gold,<br />
His born brothers, their buried bodies<br />
Be an unlikely treasure hoard.<br />

<p>I have not come to the end of Ernest Fenollosa's notes by a
long way, nor is it entirely perplexity that causes me to cease
from translation. True, I can find little to add to one line
out of a certain poem :</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%;">
"You know well where it was that I walked<br />
When you had left me."<br />
</p>

<p>In another I find a perfect speech in a literality which will
be to many most unacceptable. The couplet is as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%;">
"Drawing sword, cut into water, water again flow:<br />
Raise cup, quench sorrow, sorrow again sorry."<br />
</p>

<p>There are also other poems, notably the "Five colour
Screen," in which Professor Fenollosa was, as an art critic,
especially interested, and Rihaku's sort of Ars Poetica, which
might be given with diffidence to an audience of good will.
But if I give them, with the necessary breaks for explanation,
and a tedium of notes, it is quite certain that the personal
hatred in which I am held by many, and the <i>invidia</i> which
is directed against me because I have dared openly to declare
my belief in certain young artists, will be brought to bear
first on the flaws of such translation, and will then be merged
into depreciation of the whole book of translations. Therefore
I give only these unquestionable poems.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,

States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply

obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
